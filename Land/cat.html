                <p>
                    The Siamese cat is one of the first distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat. 
                    It derives from the Wichianmat landrace. The Siamese cat is one of several 
                    varieties of cats native to Thailand. The original Siamese became one of the 
                    most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-content" id="SiameseCat-Characteristics">
                <p> 
                    Incredibly intelligent, affectionate and opinionated, they are considered the 
                    extroverts of the feline world. Inclined to bond strongly to one person, and 
                    often very vocal with a loud, low-pitched voice (known as a 'meezer'), the 
                    Siamese is very much a 'Marmite' type of cat, appealing to a very specific 
                    sort of person!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-content" id="SiameseCat-Lifespan">
                <p> 
                    Siamese cats live up to 15 years on average, some can reach 20 years old. 
                    People love Siamese cats because they are sociable, playful, and entertaining. 
                    It is possible to train Siamese cats due to their intelligent nature. They can 
                    be trained to walk on a harness and do many tricks.

                    The British Shorthair is the pedigree version of the traditional British domestic 
                    cat, with a distinctively stocky body, thick coat, and broad face. The most familiar 
                    colour variant is the "British Blue", with a solid grey-blue coat, pineapple eyes, 
                    and a medium-sized tail.

                <p> 
                    The British is a fiercely loyal, loving cat and will attach herself to every one 
                    of her family members. While the British loves to play, she doesn't need hourly 
                    attention. If she is in the mood to play, she will find someone and bring a toy 
                    to that person.

            <div class="tab-content" id="BritishShorthair-Lifespan">
                <p> 
                    The British shorthair lifespan is 12 to 20 years. Personality: British shorthairs 
                    are friendly, if not overly affectionate. They aren't inclined to cuddle because 
                    their thick fur makes close contact feel too warm. They do like to stay nearby 
                    when their people are home, though, even if they don't sit on your lap.

                    Maine Coon cats have an affectionate nature and are very playful and friendly.

                    who enjoys sharing their home with such an enormous cat. Maine Coon cats are 
                    noted for the delightful quiet chirping sound they make.

                    known to live much longer. They are affectionate, intelligent, and sociable, 
                    enjoying the company of people without being overly clingy. Their playful and

                    This means that you should plan on spending a decade with this pet before choosing to adopt 
                    one, especially if you get one as a kitten.

                    The American Bobtail is an uncommon breed of domestic cat which was developed in the late 1960s. 
                    It is most notable for its stubby "bobbed" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal 
                    cat's tail.

                    Social and easygoing, they get along well with children and other four-legged pets. Confident and 
                    friendly, Bobtails are highly intelligent pets with dog-like personalities. They love games like 
                    fetch and hide-and-seek, and even enjoy walking on a leash with their people.

                    Bobtail personality is equally as impressive. These cats are playful, friendly, and intelligent. 
                    They adore spending time with their family, and they typically get along great with kids, dogs,

                    The Egyptian Mau is a small to medium-sized, short to medium-haired cat breed. They are one 
                    of the few naturally spotted breeds of domesticated cat. The spots of the Mau occur on only 
                    the tips of the hairs of its coat. It is considered a rare breed.

                <p>
                    The Egyptian Mau is known to be an extremely loyal cat, and while it bonds closely with other 
                    family members it often selects one or two family members as its “special person.” The breed 
                    is very affectionate, usually seeking lap time or a ride on your shoulders, typically vocalizing 
                    its pleasure with a series of chirps.

                    The lifespan of Egyptian Maus typically ranges from 10 to 15 years. Their breed — despite mostly 
                    being robust and healthy — is prone to some of these health conditions: Urolithiasis: In this 
                    condition, stony deposits are formed in the kidneys and urinary tract of your cat.

                    Most breeds of cat have three different types of hair in their coats: the outer 
                    fur or "guard hairs", a middle layer called the "awn hair"; and the down hair or 
                    undercoat, which is very fine and about 1 cm long.

                    The Singapura, or Kucinta in Singapore, is the smallest breed of cat, known for its large 
                    eyes and ears, ticked coat, and blunt tail. Despite its small size, the Singapura is playful, 
                    energetic, and affectionate. It enjoys interacting with people and other pets, making it 
                    an excellent companion for families or individuals. Its adorable appearance and friendly 
                    nature make it a popular choice for cat lovers.

                    The Singapura cat might be little, but the breed is certainly not delicate! This cat has 
                    a high-energy personality that shines. She is a curious, highly intelligent, and frisky 
                    breed that thrives on the attention of her family. Singapura cats are muscular and love 
                    to climb and explore.

                    The lifespan of Singapura cats is around 11 to 15 years, longer than that of many other 
                    breeds. Many cat experts think that it's their possible ancestry from Singaporean street 
                    cats that makes this breed sturdy and tough. However, despite being relatively healthy, 
                    these cats are prone to some genetic conditions.

                    The Lykoi is a breed of cat derived from a natural mutation causing a form of hypotrichia found 
                    in domestic short-haired cats. The mutation has occurred in domestic cats over the last 20 years. 
                    DNA testing has been done by UC Davis to confirm that the cats do not carry the Sphynx/Devon Rex 
                    gene.

                    Inquisitive and intelligent by nature they are keen hunters and even known to play fetch. They 
                    are found of company and bond well with their owns, although they may be wary of new people and 
                    pets until they get to know them. These affectionate kitties make for loving companions.

                    The Lykoi cat lifespan is similar to other cat breeds at 10 to 15 years. The Lykoi cat personality 
                    is friendly and outgoing, though reserved with strangers at first. Although they are loyal and 
                    affectionate, they are more known for playing and exploring than cuddling in laps.

                    from the feral khadzonzo landrace of eastern, coastal Kenya. The Sokoke is recognized by four major

                    Sokoke cats are very active and enjoy climbing. They tend to be vocal toward human keepers and other

                    re-homing harder for them, with a longer adjustment period expected in adult cats and older,

                    between 4 and 7 kg. The lifespan of the Australian Mist is usually 12 to 15 years.
